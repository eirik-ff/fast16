# FAST16: FAST Corner Detector for 16-bit images

This repository is a subset of the [`uzh-rpg/fast_neon`](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/fast_neon) repository used in [`uzh-rpg/rpg_svo_pro_open`](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_svo_pro_open). The original repository contains features such as SSE vectorization and ARM NEON vectorization. For simplicity, this repository removes all vectorization implementations.
